# data-extraction-evaluation-toolkit

A suite of tools, data models, etc. for extracting data from documents (e.g. papers) and evaluating the performance of such extraction tasks.

## tl, dr

A key innovation of the [Destiny project](https://destiny-evidence.github.io/website/) is a toolkit for automating the extraction of attributes of interest from documents (e.g. academic papers). This way, large repositories of published research can have relevant data extracted to use for evidence synthesis, thereby freeing up researchers to dedicate time and resources to higher-value tasks.

This software enables this end-to-end process for data extraction and evaluation tasks. **`data-extraction-evaluation-toolkit`**; or **`deet`** is conceived of as a modular suite of tools, allowing users to include and exclude specific modules in line with their needs. For instance, while you may want to supply a pdf and extract structured information from it, you may have already parsed pdfs, or other file sources into a more processing-friendly format (markdown), and hence choose to omit the parser module from your data extraction pipeline.

## Installation

### Installing `pandoc`

This software depends on [`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/), a widespread open source file/document conversion utility. In this codebase, this is implemented using `pypandoc`, but this depends on `pandoc` being installed at a system level.

```shell
brew install pandoc # mac
apt install pandoc # ubuntu/debian
choco install pandoc # windows
```

### Installing `uv`

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) is used for dependency management and managing virtual environments. You can install uv either using pipx or the uv installer script:

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Installing Dependencies

Once uv is installed, install dependencies:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:destiny-evidence/data-extraction-evaluation-toolkit.git # SSH
# or
git clone https://github.com/destiny-evidence/data-extraction-evaluation-toolkit.git # HTTPS
cd data-extraction-evaluation-toolkit
uv sync
```

### Activate your environment

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Installing pre-commit hooks

Install `pre-commit` locally (in your activated `venv`) to aid code consistency (if you're looking to contribute).

```sh
pre-commit install
```

## Using `deet`

The `data-extraction-evaluation-toolkit` (`deet`) contains mutliple modules which can be leveraged alone, or orchestrated together to form a `Pipeline`. The goal of `DEET` is to be modular and extensible, allowing users to customise a specific pipeline or workflow to their needs.

Currently, the app covers the following tools:

- **Document parsing** (from a range of formats; typically into `markdown`)
- **Gold standard data ingestion and standardisation** (currently only `eppi.json` datasets are supported out of the box, for other datasets, use the data models in `data_models/base.py` to ingest your gold standard references.)
- **LLM-powered data extraction**
- **Orchetration of tools into `Pipeline`s** (these tools can be existing `DEET` modules, custom python functions, or scripts (`R`, `python`, `bash` currently suppported.))

Our roadmap for future development contains:

- **Linking of gold standard references & pdf-derived parsed documents**
- **A fully-fledged cli for typical `deet` tasks**
- **A framework for repeatable pipeline runs with slight modifications for comparison**
- **Comparison & evaluation of LLM vs human annotations**
- **Support for prompt versioning tool**

### Default pipelines

Default pipelines leverage the included modules to chain typical, often-used data tasks.
Currently, they are implemented as scripts, but will soon be moved into a `cli`.
See available scripts prefixed with `pipeline_` in `deet/scripts/`.
All these scripts will require:

- a path to a directory of input files, `.md` or `.pdf`
- a path to a `eppi.json`
- paths to other relevant files, e.g. csvs containing prompts.
These scripts will then produce a file `llm_extractions.json` containing llm classifications for each of the files contained in the directory.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this project -- awesome, everyone's welcome.
Please see the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how best to contribute.

## Tests

Tests are written using `pytest`. You can run the tests locally using

```shell
pytest
```

Unit tests are automatically run in [Continuous Integration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) (CI) using github actions (see `.github/workflows/tests.yml`) on Pull Requests or merges into `main` or `development`. Integration tests are also run for pushes/PRs into `main` (Note: these will take approx 1-2h to complete, so consider a cup of coffee while you wait).
